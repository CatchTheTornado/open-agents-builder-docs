title: Building Workflow based agent - describing products from pictures
description: Building a workflow based agent that describes products from photos and uploads them to Shopify
order: 20

### üõ†Ô∏è What you‚Äôll build  

A **Workflow (API) agent** that:

1. accepts a product photo from the user,  
2. lets a sub-agent describe the item in natural language, and  
3. returns a ready-to-run **Shopify GraphQL `productCreate`** curl command you can paste into a terminal (or call programmatically) to add the product to your store.  

The whole process takes 5‚Äì10 minutes and zero custom code.

---

### 1.  Create the Workflow agent

| Step | Action | Where |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Log in to **openagentsbuilder.com** (a free trial is enough). | ‚Äì |
| 2 | Press **New Agent‚Ä¶** in the header. | Top bar |
| 3 | Give it a name, e.g. **‚ÄúImport product from the picture‚Äù**. | General ‚Üí *Agent Name* |
| 4 | Change **Agent type** to **App / Workflow [API]**. | General section |
| 5 | Click **Save**. | Bottom left |

> **Why a Workflow agent?**  
> Chat agents expose a conversational endpoint; Workflow agents expose **flows** that you can:  
> ‚Ä¢ run in a lightweight UI you can share with anyone, **or**  
> ‚Ä¢ call from any backend over HTTPS.

###. 2  Add a sub-agent that ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù images

1. Go to **Sub-agents ‚ûú Add agent‚Ä¶**.  
2. Name it **‚ÄúPhoto descriptor‚Äù**.  
3. Leave the model as **gpt-4o** (or whichever model you prefer).  
4. Paste a short **System prompt** ‚Äì e.g.:

```text
You're great at extracting the features of a product from a picture
and generating structured descriptions.
```

5. **Save**.

_No extra tools are needed here because the only job is to convert an image into text + a GraphQL snippet. If you later want the agent to hit the Shopify API directly, you could add an ‚ÄúHTTP request‚Äù tool._

---

### 3.  Design the flow

#### 3.1.  Create the flow shell

1. Open **Flows ‚ûú Add flow**.  
2. Name it **Describe product** ‚Äì set the *Flow code* to `describe-product` (this string becomes part of the API URL).  
3. **Save** to reveal the flow designer.

#### 3.2.  Define inputs

1. In the **Inputs** accordion press **Add input**.  
2. Fill in:  

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Symbol** | `productPhoto` |
| **Description** | Picture of the product you want to describe |
| **Type** | **File (b64)** |
| **Required** | ‚úì |

That single input is all the UI the end-user will see.

#### 3.3.  Build the sequence (one simple step)

1. In **Sequence** click **Add step**.  
2. Choose **Agent ‚Üí Photo descriptor**.  
3. Paste the prompt below (notice the `@productPhoto` variable reference ‚Äì type **@** to autocomplete):

```text
Get the photo @productPhoto and:

1. Write a detailed yet concise **Product Description** in plain English.
2. Directly underneath, produce a **GraphQL API call to Shopify** that creates this product, including two option sets:
   ‚Ä¢ Color (infer values from the image)  
   ‚Ä¢ Size  (Small, Medium, Large)

Use the exact curl format below as a template, replacing the title and option values.

curl -X POST \
https://your-development-store.myshopify.com/admin/api/2025-04/graphql.json \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'X-Shopify-Access-Token: {access_token}' \
-d '{
  "query": "mutation { productCreate(product: {title: \"Cool socks\", productOptions: [{name: \"Color\", values: [{name: \"Red\"}, {name: \"Blue\"}]}, {name: \"Size\", values: [{name: \"Small\"}, {name: \"Medium\"}, {name: \"Large\"}]}]) { product { id title } userErrors { field message } } }"
}'
```

4. **Save** the flow and then the agent.

---

### 4.  Test in the built-in debugger

1. Open the **Debugger** tab.  
2. Upload any product image (PNG/JPG/WebP).  
3. Click **Execute**.  

The **Trace** panel shows each step:  
* `sequenceAgent` ‚Üí `Photo descriptor` (generation)  
The final message contains your product description and a ready-made **curl** command with the correct title and option values.

---

### 5.  Share or integrate

#### 5.1.  One-click share link

* Go to **Run & Share** ‚Üí **Share the flow link**.  
* Copy the unique URL and hand it to anyone.  
* They‚Äôll see a minimal form (one file-picker) and the same result screen ‚Äì no login needed.

#### 5.2.  Call from your backend

At the bottom of **Run & Share** you‚Äôll find **Run via API**.

* **Endpoint** ‚Äì already includes your `database-id-hash` and `flow=describe-product`.  
* **Modes**  
  * **Execution mode**:  
    * *Synchronous* ‚Äì waits for completion (small jobs).  
    * *Asynchronous* ‚Äì returns a `result_id`; fetch the result later (long jobs or batching).  
  * **Output mode**:  
    * *Stream* (default) ‚Äì chunks partial output for progress bars.  
    * *Buffer* ‚Äì delivers the whole response in one piece.

Here‚Äôs an example synchronous streaming request (replace placeholders):

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "database-id-hash: 35f5c5b139a6b569d4649b788c1851831eb44d8e32b716b8411ec6431af8121d" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -F flow=describe-product \
  -F execution=synchronous \
  -F output=stream \
  -F productPhoto=@/path/to/photo.jpg \
  https://app.openagentsbuilder.com/exec
```

The JSON response contains `text` (the product description) and `attachments` (if any).

---

### 6.  Paste into Shopify (or automate it)

The curl snippet returned by the agent still contains:

* **`{access_token}`** ‚Äì your **private-app or custom-app Admin API token**.  
* `https://your-development-store.myshopify.com` ‚Äì swap for your store domain.

Run the command and the product appears in **Shopify Admin ‚Üí Products** with the color- and size-option scaffolding already in place.

*Tip:* Once you‚Äôre comfortable you can remove the curl wrapper from the prompt and instead give the sub-agent the **HTTP tool** to hit Shopify directly ‚Äì but keeping it as text first is a safe way to validate output.

---

### 7.  Next ideas

* **Bulk importer** ‚Äì switch to asynchronous execution and let users drop a ZIP of images.  
* **Attribute enrichment** ‚Äì add parallel steps: one agent extracts materials, another suggests price based on similar listings.  
* **Language variants** ‚Äì duplicate the description step for DE, FR, ES and merge the results.

### That‚Äôs it!  
You now have a no-code micro-service that turns a photo into a Shopify-ready API call. Duplicate the pattern for invoices, blog covers, or anything else your store needs üöÄ
