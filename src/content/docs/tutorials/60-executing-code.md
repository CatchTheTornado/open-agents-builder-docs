### Why code execution?

Open Agents Builder can now **write, run, and iterate on code** in a Docker sandbox. Shell, Node.js, and Python are pre-installed‚Äîbut you can add Ruby (or anything else) in minutes.

A code-capable agent lets you:

* **Query live APIs** (GitHub, Stripe, ‚Ä¶) without exposing keys to the user.
* **Transform user data**‚Äîconvert, clean, visualise.
* **Iterate automatically**: When the script fails, the LLM inspects the traceback, patches the code, and re-runs it.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement                     | Notes                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open Agents Builder account** | Sign up for the free trial; takes \~3 min                                                                                |
| **A GitHub repo URL**           | Any public repo works. We‚Äôll use [`CatchTheTornado/open-agents-builder`](https://github.com/CatchTheTornado/open-agents-builder) in this tutorial. |
| *(Optional)* Local install      | Clone the project & run it locally if you want to watch container logs in real-time                                        |

### Creating a new agent 

1. **Dashboard ‚Üí ‚ÄúNew Agent‚Ä¶‚Äù**
<Image alt="" src="../../../assets/tutorials/34.png" />

2. **Name it** ‚Üí `Project condition checker`.

3. Keep **Agent type** = *Smart assistant \[Chat]*.

---

### Writing the system prompt 

In **AI Prompt** tab:

```text
You're a smart, open-source-savvy agent that can help users check their GitHub projects.
You can use the code execution tool to fulfil user requests.
Welcome the user and ask them for the GitHub project URL.
Generate a document with a summary of the last two issues and a general overview.
Generate a PNG diagram with the stargazers' history.
```

Screenshot for reference:

> **Tip**
> Keep prompts *declarative*: describe the workflow & deliverables‚Äîlet the LLM decide *how*.

---

### Enabling the *Code Execution* tool 

1. Go to **Tools** ‚Üí **Add Tool** ‚Üí choose **Code Execution**.
<Image alt="" src="../../../assets/tutorials/36.png" />


2. No extra config is needed‚Äîhit **Save**.

**Under the hood** the agent now spins up a disposable Docker container and uses the open-source `code-interpreter-tool` library to run scripts, capture output, and return any generated files.

---

### Previewing & test-driving your agent

1. Click **Preview**.

2. The agent greets you and asks for a repo URL.
   Paste `https://github.com/CatchTheTornado/open-agents-builder`.

3. Watch the magic ‚ú®

   * The LLM writes a Python script to hit the GitHub API.
   * If a run fails, it parses the traceback, patches the code, and retries (subtitles 00:03:37-00:03:59).
   * When succeeded, it uploads two files:

     | File                     | Purpose                         |
     | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
     | `project_summary.md`     | Issues overview & repo stats    |
     | `stargazers_history.png` | Auto-generated Matplotlib chart |

   Example chat view:
   <Image alt="" src="../../../assets/tutorials/39.png" />


> **Heads-up**
> You‚Äôll see `Code executed with errors‚Ä¶` lines if the *first* attempt fails‚Äîthis is expected. The agent will fix & re-run automatically.

---

### Handling generated files 

Every chat session stores artefacts in **Sessions** ‚Üí select a session ‚Üí file list appears on the right.
<Image alt="" src="../../../assets/tutorials/37.png" />

Click **‚¨áÔ∏è** to download, or reference them in follow-up prompts, e.g.:

```
Can you create a .docx that combines the summary and the chart?
```

The agent will:

* Import `python-docx` (or install it on the fly).
* Embed the PNG and markdown content.
* Return `github_project_report.docx`.

---

## Going further

* **Add other languages**: extend the Docker image or mount a custom one.
* **Chain tools**: enrich with a *Browser* tool to fetch web pages, or *Automations* to send scheduled reports.
* **Safety**: define rate limits and guardrails in the **Safety Rules** tab.
* **Template it**: when your agent is stable, click **‚ÄúSave agent as template‚Äù** to share.

---

## Conclusion

You now have a fully-featured GitHub analyst powered by live code execution‚Äîno backend coding required. Experiment with different prompts, outputs (PDF, CSV, PowerPoint‚Ä¶), and data sources. The only limit is your imagination.

**Happy hacking!** üõ†Ô∏èüßë‚Äçüíª
